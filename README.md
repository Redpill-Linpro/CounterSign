CounterSign
===========

A.  BUILDING AND DEBUGGING COUNTERSIGN

Some of the Maven operations (such as running the project) require some additional
JVM settings:

export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n"

Running this project:

mvn install -Prun

Building this project:

mvn clean package


B.  CREATING A ROOT SIGNING CERT, KEYS AND STORES

To generate a root CA key and cert:

1. Generate an RSA key for the root CA and store it in a file:

openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096

2.  Create a self-signed root CA certificate

openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

3.  Create a p12 file containing the key and certificate

openssl pkcs12 -export -in ca.crt -inkey ca.key -name countersign -out ca.p12

4.  Make note of the keystore password and alias (-name value), CounterSign will need this to access the key / cert


C.  KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

1.  Document previews generated by PDF2SWF will show "Signature not Verified" messages on all signatures.
This is a limitation of SWFTools.  If CounterSign is set up properly and the right signing
certificates are provided and trusted by Adobe Reader, the signatures should be properly verified
when viewed in Reader.
